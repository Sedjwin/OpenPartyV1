Their entire proposed budget is visible to all their followers. If a special interest group influenced their plan, the change would be instantly visible, leading to a real-time loss of support. They can only lead by proposing plans that people genuinely believe in. Backroom deals become politically toxic when the 'room' is a transparent platform."
